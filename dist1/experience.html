        Experience</h1>

    <h2 style= "color: #eece1a;"> Software Engineer - Solidigm, Rancho Cordova, CA<span style="padding-left:450px;"> December 2021- December 2023</h2>
    <h4 style= "margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Firmware Development and Validation</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Enhanced device security by creating new data encryption features using RSA Signature. I led efforts in debugging firmware,
        analyzing issues, and offering solutions, while managing firmware loading through JTAG and resolving errors with C++ script 
        debugging. I integrated Solidigm Client SSDs with OEM configurations, delivering firmware binaries ahead of schedule to identify 
        issues early. I established a continuous validation infrastructure, collaborating with DevOps teams to develop test plans and cases,
        and performed comprehensive validation across Windows and Linux environments. My role involved triaging firmware failures, 
        collaborating with senior engineers to determine root causes, and improving Python security test scripts to enhance validation
        coverage for NVMe SSDs.</p>
    <h4 style= "margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Web Development and Deployment</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Enhanced multifaceted responsive web application by introducing new features, crafting additional web pages, and refining the
        overall user experience. Conducted unit, functional, regression testing and successfully deployed updates. Maintained and 
        ensured the web application's database met operational requirements and handled troubleshooting tasks related to database issues.
    </p>
    <h4 style= "margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;">GIT Repository Manager</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding: 0;"> Established and managed two GIT repositories for a group of 15 firmware developers, overseeing
        tasks such as code merges, developers' branch management, and orchestrating production firmware
        releases using GIT operations. Managed an FTP server dedicated to firmware package file transfers and maintained notifications
        for the release of firmware packages within the engineering organization.
    </p>

    <h2 style= "color: #eece1a;"> Software Engineer - Intel, Folsom, CA <span style="padding-left:575px;">Septemeber 2021- December 2021</h2>
    <h4 style= " margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Web Development</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0;"> Designed and implemented a feature in the integration tool that enables the comparison of two Client SSD product configurations,
        thereby reducing the time required for data analysis by the engineering team. Identified and diagnosed failures within the 
        firmware integration tool and collaborated with stakeholders and engineering teams to gather requirements for new web 
        application features. Worked closely with senior engineers and stakeholders to address and resolve issues
        across both the user interface and backend functionalities of our web applications.
